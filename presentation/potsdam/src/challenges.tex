    We presented a first version of our new {\nbody} code,
    written purely in C/C++ and CUDA, called \red{\GR}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The current version of our code,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item evolves a globular cluster, using and \blue{Hermite 4th order}
                integration scheme, using block time steps.
            \item has a \blue{suitable} in the energy conservation,
                reaching errors around $\approx 10^{-9}$ and $\approx 10^{-7}$-
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

        \item Modular code,
        \item Documentation,
        \item Hermite 4th order integrator scheme,
        \item Block time steps,

    \framesubtitle{the next steps (1/2)}

    \begin{itemize}
%        \item Publication in the ISI Journal ``Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS)''.
        \item Continue the \blue{research} on {\nbody} integrators, like
                higher order Hermite schemes.
        \item More physical phenomena treatments,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \blue{Neighbors treatment}, to handle the binary formation,
                This has been proved by using a time-symmetric integration scheme
                for the binary system, which is described in the work of~\cite{myriad}.

            \item Handle \blue{semi-Keplerian} systems,
                    {\nbody} systems with a central massive particle~\cite{ulf},
                    like a massive black hole (MBH) in the galactic center,
                    or a star in a protoplanetary system, etc.

            \item Post-Newtonian terms into the acceleration and its derivatives.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Porting the code towards large GPU clusters, \blue{multi-GPU} environment.
        \item Studying \blue{new computational improvements},
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Numerical precision,
            \item Mixed-parallel schemes,
            \item Different architectures,
        \end{itemize}
        \item Use GPU Computing to solve additional Astrophysical problems,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH).
        \end{itemize}
